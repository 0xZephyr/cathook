# Disclaimer
I know that the style sucks. There is a lot of design errors and cancerous patterns. Most of the code was intended to be *temporary*.

# Compilation
`git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning, then
`make`

# Injection
`sudo ./attach-backtrace` if you want to see backtrace after the game crashes.
